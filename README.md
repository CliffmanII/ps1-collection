# CliffmanII/ps1-collection

This repository is a dump of scripts/scriptlets I have written over the years. Functinoality is not promised out of the box.

## Description

Many of the scripts automate tasks or allow common systems administrations tasks to be performed in a CLI environment. Many work in RMM CLIs, like ConnectWise Manage/Automate or NinjaOne's PowerShell modules
Some of these scripts were designed with specific purpose or environments in mind. Where it has been deemed neccessary, I have removed or redacted PII. If error output points to code like "#Company Redcated#" or other "#(item) Redacted#", then the script was modified to remove PII or company data. Edits will need to be made for the script to be functional. 
Use at your own risk, edit for your uses at your will.
